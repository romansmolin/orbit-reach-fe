                                account, you grant OrbitReach permission to access certain information and
                                perform actions (for example, publishing posts) as allowed by that

                                collect your social media login passwords; authentication is handled
                                securely by the platforms (we receive tokens, not credentials).

                                Your privacy is very important to us. Our collection and use of personal
                                information through OrbitReach is explained in our Privacy Policy. By using
                                the Service, you agree that we can collect and use your information in
                                accordance with the Privacy Policy. In particular, by connecting OrbitReach
                                to your social media accounts, you consent to our access of certain data
                                from those accounts as described in these Terms and in the Privacy
                                Policy. We strive to follow best practices and platform policies
                                regarding user data (for example, we do not sell personal data, and we
                                honor deletion requests). For details, please review the Privacy Policy
                                section of this document.

                                on the target platform can depend on the platform&apos;s API availability
                                and performance, which are outside OrbitReach&apos;s control. We disclaim

                                may not apply to you.
