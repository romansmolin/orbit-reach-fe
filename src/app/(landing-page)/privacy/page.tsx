                                When you connect your social media accounts to OrbitReach, we receive
                                certain information from those third-party accounts, as permitted by you
                                and the platform&apos;s API. For each connected social network, this
                                typically includes an authentication token (so we can act on your behalf
                                without knowing your password), your profile name and ID, and any content
                                or data that you explicitly ask us to fetch or manage. For example:

                                data. We also do not collect sensitive personal data from social networks
                                that is not required for our functionality. In summary, we retrieve only
                                the required info needed to publish your posts and display basic info
                                about your linked social accounts, and nothing more (data minimization

                                OrbitReach respects your privacy and shares your information only in

                                Obviously, when you use OrbitReach to publish content on a social media
                                platform, we send that content (along with necessary credentials) to the
                                platform&apos;s API to execute the post. This means we share data with
                                the social networks at your direction. For example, if you schedule a
                                post for Platform X, the content is transmitted to Platform X when the
                                time comes, just as if you had entered it on their app. These third-party
                                platforms process that content under their own terms and privacy

                                as long as you maintain an OrbitReach account. If you delete your account
                                or if it&apos;s terminated, we will delete or anonymize this information
                                within a reasonable period, except for any data we are required to retain
                                for legal compliance or legitimate business purposes (for example,

                                Content that you schedule or publish through OrbitReach may be stored in
                                our database to facilitate scheduling and editing. Once a post is
                                published, we may retain the content for your later review (unless you
                                delete it from our interface). You can delete any scheduled or past post
                                content from OrbitReach at any time, and it will be removed from our active
                                systems (it may remain in secure backups for a limited duration until
                                those backups cycle out). Note that deleting a post in OrbitReach does not
                                delete the copy of that content on the social platform; you would need to
                                delete the post directly on the social network if desired.

                                Additionally, if you disconnect a social media account from OrbitReach, we

                                HTTPS. Sensitive data (such as authentication tokens and passwords) are
                                encrypted at rest in our database. We store your OrbitReach account

                                authorize us with tokens issued by the platforms, which can be
                                individually revoked by you.

                                Depending on your location and applicable law (such as the EU&apos;s
                                GDPR, California&apos;s CCPA, etc.), you may have certain rights
                                regarding your personal data. We honor applicable data subject rights
                                requests and provide similar controls to all users as a matter of good
                                practice. These rights may include:
                            </p>

                            <p className="mb-4">
                                You can request a copy of the personal data we hold about you, and
                                information on how it&apos;s used. We can provide this in a
                                machine-readable format. Much of your data (posts and profile info) is
                                available directly in your account dashboard, but you can also contact us
                                for a full export.
                            </p>

                                If any personal information we have is inaccurate or outdated, you have
                                the right to request a correction. You can update some of your account
                                information directly in your profile settings, or reach out to us for
                                help.

                            <p className="mb-4">
                                You have the right to request deletion of your personal data. As noted
                                above, you may delete your account at any time, which will remove most
                                data. If you prefer, you can also contact us to request deletion of
                                specific information. We will comply unless we are legally permitted or
                                required to keep the data (in which case we will explain why). Keep in
                                mind, as noted, that deleting data from OrbitReach does not remove content
                                you posted to external social networks.
                            </p>

                                You have the right to object to or ask us to limit (restrict) processing
                                of your data under certain circumstances – for example, you can ask that
                                we stop using your data for marketing emails (which we will honor by
                                opting you out). If you have concerns about any other form of processing,
                                let us know and we will review and accommodate if required.
                            </p>

                                If you have given consent to any optional data processing (for instance,
                                if in the future we seek your consent for something like sharing info
                                with a partner), you can withdraw that consent at any time for future
                                processing. Withdrawing consent will not affect the legality of what we
                                did with your data before you withdrew.

                                OrbitReach operates globally. If you are located outside the country where
                                our servers or headquarters are, your information (including personal
                                data) may be transferred to and stored on servers in a country different
                                from yours. We primarily use cloud hosting in [USA or specify region],
                                though this may change as we adopt global infrastructure. Regardless of
                                where data is stored, we apply the same privacy protections described in
                                this policy.

                                level of protection. This may involve using standard contractual clauses
                                approved by the EU, or transferring to jurisdictions deemed adequate by
                                regulators, or other appropriate safeguards. By using OrbitReach, you
